# InvisioVault

**InvisioVault** is an innovative Flask-based application that securely embeds any type of file into an image. By leveraging file compression, it ensures efficient storage, even when the file size exceeds the image's visual dimensions. With InvisioVault, you can securely hide and retrieve files, offering a creative blend of functionality and privacy.
